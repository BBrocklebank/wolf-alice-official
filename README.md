<br>  <br>
The sites main purpose is to provide a hub of content/information to new and returning fans of the band. This is with the aim of increasing listeners across streaming services and producing higher sales of tickers/merchandise as a result. Second to this the site also provides clickthrough to social media, where users will be further exposed to the bands content/marketing. Signup for direct inbox updates and announcements is also provided to further submerse users in content.

Wolf Alice official’s target audience is diverse in sense of background, age and qualifications, as music can be incredibly subjective.

## Design 

### Wireframes

The following wireframes were constructed within Balsamiq(link this) during the Scope Plane section of the design and planning stage for this project. They represent an early design concept that has largely been kept to through to final product. However do note that they vary slightly from the final design, this is due to practical considerations that arose during the surface plane stage.

### Navigation Map 

This navigation map shows final navigational paths through the site. There are pages listed here that are external links only, this is due to time constraints on the project. 

[Site Map](assets/images/site-map.png)

### Colours 

The most prominent colours used are black, aqua blue, off-white and pale grey. Aqua blue is the colour of the Wolf Alice logo and thus fit the visual design. Note that the aqua blue used on various elements and the nav-bar is slightly brighter than the official logo, this is to increase contrast by design.

Background colours were chosen to contrast with images, icons and text as well as reduce eyestrain by being pale and not being overly bright shades. 

### Fonts

Roboto is the primary font for text on the site. This has been chosen due to it’s slightly curved design making it very easy to read at small sizes as well as large, great for responsiveness. A fallback font of Sans-serif has been set if for any reason Roboto is not displayed. Roboto was designed for use on the Android operating system and so is very compatible and fit for this purpose.

Benne is the font being applied to all headings and the navigation bar at the top of the site. This has been selected to as closely as possible match the official logo font for Wolf Alice. The continuity of the font across the sit has a very pleasing aesthetic effect and allows style to be applied without the sit feeling too “busy”. It is also a lightweight and clean font, responding well to smaller screen sizes.

### Icons/Links

Icons are used throughout the site in various fashions and are integral to the user stories and primary function of the site. Semantically placed the icons allow users to instinctively clickthrough from the site to desired destinations i.e. social media, streaming services.

Social media icons were used to display anchor tags linking to their related channels. The use of these highly recognisable and obvious icons allows any user to quickly access their preferred platform. This is again repeated with icons linking to related music streaming platforms, obvious icons are used for the user to select their relevant link. 


### Styling

The layout of the site uses a repeated customised bootstrap grid design behind all content across the pages. This continuity is pleasing and doesn’t confuse.

Album artworks and related information are held within containers, the information with a border. This boxed design is clean and sharp allowing a large amount of information to be displayed without confusing the user. The repeated design is logical and naturally invites the user to scroll down to reveal more. On smaller screen sizes the borders around text are removed to cater to reduces size, reducing any cluttered feeling and refreshing the design.

As part of the design, this boxed approach allows for easy maintenance and site updates in the future. New information and images need only be added to copied segments of code. This applies to related icons/links also. 

### Images

Aesthetics on a band site are imperative. Images are the best way to immediately imprint on the user and encourage them to stay. The full-width hero image on the home screen is stark, impactful and has been placed to cause intrigue. 

Album artworks are essential in the marketing of audio as they’re often the only images associated. The artworks on the site have been positioned and sized to offer a strong platter of contrast and colour. 

The image found on the Biography page has been chosen to relate to the frequently referenced live shows found in the biography text. 

### Backgrounds

An off white bass found to the sides is covered by a darker cloudy grey in the centre to enable a strong but unobtrusive background to overlay information.

## Video 

Wolf Alice’s latest single has been embedded via Youtube into the homepage, diversifying the type of content available to the user. This imbues a sense of immediate discovery for the new release and doesn’t require the user to leave the page. It is hoped that this immediate immersion in the music will increase conversions of visitors into customers of music/merchandise etc. It also delivers quickly an idea of who the band are artistically.
