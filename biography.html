                        It is now more than a decade since Wolf Alice began;
                        first as a duo made up of Rowsell and guitarist Joff Oddie, then later expanding to a
                        four-piece,
                        with drummer Joel Amey and bassist Theo Ellis. Their music was magnetic: masters of the fiery
                        chorus,
                        the grunge riff, the whisper and the rebel-yell. Meanwhile Rowsell’s lyrics told of youth and
                        young womanhood,
                        of nights out, best friends, bus rides home; of desire, and rage, freedom, and joy.

                        A run of EPs was followed, in 2015, by their debut album My Love Is Cool, which reached number
                        two in the UK album charts,
                        and received a Grammy nomination for the track “Moaning Lisa Smile”. Its successor, Visions of a
                        Life, came two years later,
                        and won the 2018 Mercury Prize. There have been global tours, support slots for Foo Fighters,
                        Queens of the Stone Age, and Liam Gallagher,
                        and the band were the subject of a film by revered director Michael Winterbottom.

                    <p>
                        Writing a follow-up to Visions of a Life was daunting. The success of that album, coupled with
                        the many months spent on tour — the slog of shows
                        and flights and hotels and long bus journeys across many miles, had taken a creative toll. “When
                        we stopped touring,” recalls Rowsell,
                        “I thought ‘Fuck, I haven’t written any songs…’”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The band decamped to an Air B’n’B in Somerset, and it was here that they reconfigured who they
                        were together, far away from festival stages, tour buses,
                        awards shows, and fans. They cemented their friendship, had a somewhat ramshackle night out, and
                        set to work on some fledgling demos in a converted church.
                        “We didn’t have a filter on any ideas,” says Ellis. “Any idea was a good idea at that point. And
                        we did everything really haphazardly, but it was just about
                        getting it working again, having a place to convene, getting ourselves into that atmosphere.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rowsell also discovered she had the beginnings of more songs than she had thought. “I didn’t
                        realise I had written them,” she explains.
                        “Just because I didn’t know what was good anymore. It had been so long since we had written new
                        songs together that I was afraid to show anyone, and for them to say
                        ‘These suck! You can’t write songs anymore!’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact during their time away from the studio Rowsell had evolved considerably as a songwriter,
                        and the band were struck by the new maturity to her lyrics.
                        “I think these are the best songs Ellie’s ever written,” says Oddie. She has acquired that rare
                        songwriting gift — the ability to tread the fine line between
                        consummate storyteller and confessional lyricist. And, too, she has realised that there can be
                        both strength and solace in vulnerability. “This album is for other people.”
                        she says. Its songs were written with the hope that they “might make people feel listened to if
                        they are going through something.” Blue Weekend’s tales of love and
                        breakups and close bonds and disillusionment, are largely the product of Rowsell’s realisation
                        of the role of music in our lives, of the importance of the songs she writes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Sometimes you hear a song and it makes you feel better, or you hear a song and it makes you
                        feel seen,” she explains.
                        “I remember feeling blue about something, and thinking ‘I wonder what songs I can listen to that
                        will be about what I’m feeling right now’.
                        It was almost as if I was desperate to feel better about something, and I would go down any path
                        to feel not alone in something, or to understand it more.
                        And I’ve never really done that before intentionally, I’d never really sought it out.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While these songs are categorically “not a diary entry” they are nonetheless rooted in Rowsell’s
                        own experiences. “I’m really nervous about
                        this album because it does sound like you can tell what I’ve gone through,” she says. “But I had
                        to keep telling myself it was worth it.
                        And only I can tell you what is real and what is not, and I don’t have to tell anyone.”

                    <p>
                        In lieu of live performance, they have made a series of music videos to accompany each of the
                        songs on the new album. They hope it will offer a
                        way to connect with the fans they cannot yet see, to draw their audience close again, even in a
                        time of great distance. “You just feel hungry for
                        something like that,” Oddie says. “For the sense of community that is implicit in those events.
                        Because the level of connection that you have between the
                        four of you on stage, doing something in front of thousands of people, is so profound. It’s such
                        a unique thing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rowsell, too, hopes that the new confidence Wolf Alice have found as songwriters will mean these
                        songs will forge an even greater bond with their audiences.
                        “One of the things that has moved me in my career is when I’m playing shows and I see a 60 year
                        old man closing his eyes and singing along next to a 16 year old girl,”
                        she says. “We don’t write specifically for one person. We just go based on what moves us, and
                        hope that if it moves us, it moves someone else.”
